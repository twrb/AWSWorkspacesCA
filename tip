Workspaces/ is really helpful.

For future readers, if you still struggling with this problem, also try with bruntonspall's github link: https://github.com/bruntonspall/AWSWorkspacesCA

The following step is create all keys and certificates in same machine (CA machine), for prod use case, you should create client public and private key in client machine:

(only do this step if you want to renew or did not create and upload your CA public key before) run ./CA/gen_CA.sh, which will generate CA's private and public key, copy the public key (.pem file) and upload it onto AWS Workspaces's Directory Service's Access Control Options (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/latest/adminguide/trusted-devices.html#configure-restriction).
run ./client/gen_client.sh, which will generate client private and public key and corresponding CA sign certificate.
copy pfx (or say p12) certificate file to your windows laptop, click install, select current user and personal store.
Now you should be able to login with your workspaces client (suppose you already setup AWS Workspaces side correctly with other settings).
